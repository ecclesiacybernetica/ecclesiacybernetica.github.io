    "text": "Can the pope, who heads a religious institution as old as the Catholic Church, decide the fate of artificial intelligence? It is true that the Catholic Church has always been considered a conservative institution, but it has also constantly sought to respond to events affecting the world. This was the case with Leo XIII. His encyclical Rerum novarum was a response to the new reality in which socialist movements were gaining increasing influence over the working masses left to fend for themselves by radical liberal economics. Pope Leo XIII had the courage to propose a third way. Today, the number one topic is not socialism, but artificial intelligence, which is why the Vatican is also speaking out on this issue. In this post, I will show how cybernetics can help us understand the Pope’s decisions."

    "text": "A bird’s eye view\nThe Pope acts like a ship’s navigator who must respond to changing conditions at sea. If he notices a change in the wind or a dangerous wave, he must, on the one hand, adjust the position of the boat accordingly so that it does not capsize, but on the other hand, he must not miss his destination port. This was the case in the 19th century. In response to the dire situation of workers, socialist movements emerged. Leo XIII saw the evil of the Marxists, but he also saw the tragic plight of the workers, whose difficult situation was the result of a radically liberal approach to the economy. Looking at the direction of the winds of history, the pope had to turn the rudder to be able to sail in the same direction. A similar challenge now faces his successor, Pope Leo XIV. Currently, that challenge is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is used almost everywhere, from schools to the military and even in liturgy, and the pace of change is dizzying. Again, there are at least two options: reject AI or accept it unreservedly. This is too obvious. A radical choice of either option is like a sudden movement of the rudder, which can end badly for the crew, the boat, and the journey. In this sense, the pope must be a skilled helmsman and navigator."

    "text": "Historical background\nPrudence dictates that we learn from past experiences in order to recognize what is repeating itself and what is new. It is clear that there is a similar pattern here as in the 19th century. This provides a clue for finding a solution. At the end of the 19th century, the Church faced socialism and the first industrial revolution, or rather its negative consequences. These changes were accompanied by divisions within the Church between conservative and liberal factions in the struggle against modernism. John Henry Newman was an example of a victim of this struggle. In Germany, there was a cultural struggle between the Prussian government and Catholicism. The encyclical Rerum novarum was the result of a long-term project. In 1950, Carlo Maria Curci founded the magazine La Civiltà Cattolica1, which aimed to present the Church’s point of view on religious and political issues at the highest intellectual level (Hales 1962), in the face of propaganda and physical attacks on the papacy. Two other Jesuits, Matteo Liberatore SJ (1810-1892) and Luigi Taparelli SJ (1793-1862), were involved in the founding of the magazine. Their writings paved the way for the encyclical Rerum novarum, which was prepared by Liberatore and the Dominican Cardinal Tommaso Maria Zigliara.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon XIII. (Source: Braun et Compagnie - Observador.pt Public Domain)\n\n\nLeo XIII began a dialogue with culture, setting a new course. He chose the name Leo because of the conciliatory approach of the previous pope of that name towards secular governments. The course he chose was not as harsh as that of his predecessor. This conciliatory character is also evident in the encyclical. He did not opt for liberalism or Marxism, but proposed a new solution. In this way, he was able to steer the Church through these turbulent waters. In terms of church policy, Leo XIII did what every sailor does: he looked at the sea and the wind and adjusted the ship’s position with the rudder to maintain the same course despite changes in the environment and the ship’s position. In steering a ship, the position of the rudder is constantly adjusted to the effect it has on the ship, creating a feedback loop that allows the course to be maintained in a changing environment, responding to disturbances from the wind and waves. (Gage 2007)\nWhat the pope must do, then, is to observe, like a helmsman, where we are, what the environment is like, how it can affect the ship, in order to maintain the course and ultimately reach the destination to which the Church is heading. The key is not only to give orders, but also to speak so that people listen, to observe the environment and the behavior of the ship, i.e., feedback. The analogy between steering a ship and Leo XIII’s policy is therefore clear. This is also a cybernetic conclusion. Certain problems, even though they concern different situations, whether a ship, a society, or an algorithm, show certain similarities. We look at the destination, give orders, check the reactions, and correct the course accordingly."

Probably, a ban on AI could only come after some kind of global catastrophe like Hiroshima. The question is how to approach these new conditions “at sea.” What can the Church do? Compared to the 19th century, the pace of development is now frantic, and the amount of information that needs to be taken into account is enormous. In short, the environment has become extremely complex. However, it is clear that the Church does not intend to stand idly by and watch the approaching tsunami, but is issuing specific documents on AI and new technologies that set benchmarks for a sober view of the changes taking place. The current social transformation has been clearly defined by Klaus Schwab as another industrial revolution, analogous to the industrial revolution of the 19th century. As in Marx’s time, it is suggested today that science will challenge God. (Harari 2017) Thus, the challenges faced by Leo XIII and Leo XIV are very similar.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeon XIIV.

    "text": "What does this show?\nFirstly, it shows the Church’s ability to adapt to changing conditions. Although these reactions are often delayed, this delay allows for an adequate response to change and the proposal of a solution. The slowness may be dictated by the fact that the Church is not a motorboat, but a transoceanic ship. As before, it is the Pope who acts as the helmsman, who must navigate using changes to maintain constancy. Like a gyroscope, which, thanks to being constantly in motion, maintains remarkable stability. This rule applies not only to the Church, but also to other institutions and even all living organisms: in order to survive and remain oneself, one must change. What the Church has shown so far is an amazing ability to preserve its identity despite changing conditions."

    "text": "Summary\nIn this short post, we have looked at the Pope not only as a priest and head of state, but also in his role as a helmsman whose task is to maintain the course set by Christ amid the changing waters of history. Certain analogies with previous historical challenges have been shown. These analogies allow us to understand institutional adaptation, but also serve as a warning for future decisions. The Pope is a helmsman, and the experience of the Church can point to remedies for today’s situation, which contains both new and old elements. On the other hand, developments in the science of institutional management can also point to solutions that are beneficial to the Church. The role of this blog will be to answer the question of what this means in particular and what tools contemporary science provides for improving communication and better orientation in the surrounding environment. What do you think the current situation of balancing identity and adaptation in the Church looks like, and what other analogies do you see between Leo XIII and Leo XIV?"

How does the Pope know who is right in the conflict in the Middle East, who is telling the truth, and who is lying?\nThese questions are related to the two previous articles and boil down to how the Pope, or more broadly, the Church, makes decisions. We said that the Pope must steer the Church, i.e., make decisions. This post is about how the oldest institution in the world makes decisions in the digital age. Where does he get his information, and how does he give orders, or, in cybernetic terms, what are the feedback loops in the management of the Vatican?"

    "text": "Traditional decision-making process\nThe traditional way of receiving feedback in the Church, as in any bureaucracy, was through a hierarchy: parish priests reported problems to the bishop, bishops to cardinals/the Roman Curia, and they to the pope, who made the decisions. On a day-to-day basis, these were standard bureaucratic standards and procedures, but sometimes, when the situation deviated from the norm (we fear nothing but precedent!), a council was convened to determine new procedures or to determine which ones were appropriate. In recent times, such councils have been the Council of Trent, Vatican I, and Vatican II. Traditionally, it could be said that the Vatican mills ground slowly. Decisions were made over a period of many years, decades, or even centuries."

Issues such as the abuse crisis, problems with liberal theologians and ecology must be resolved more quickly. It is not so much difficult to find a solution, but often even to locate the problem. Bishops may not be able to keep up with the development of AI, let alone find a solution to the problems. Connections other than just hierarchy are needed. More networks need to be created with scientists, such as academic institutions, etc.\nContemporary conditions require, first of all, taking into account the speed at which information appears. For example, an article about a new bishop who is controversial appears on the internet. This was also the case in the past, but today, there may be pressure from people on social media and the internet that will be difficult to resist."

    "section": "Speed vs. depth of analysis",
    "text": "Speed vs. depth of analysis\nThe advantage of traditional loops is depth. Decisions are not made hastily, but after consultation and reflection. Many decisions are not made at all, in the name of the principle of “you have to know how to wait,” and most problems will resolve themselves. Here, we can compare two extreme approaches: no decisions at all, or attempting to solve every problem immediately. Often, there is no time for such a deep analysis, decisions must be made now. Where can information be obtained, then? Then, you have to seek information elsewhere, directly. The need to speed up decisions is influenced not only by the nature of the matter itself, such as a crisis, but also by pressure from the group. If all the media in the world said that something had to be changed and the Pope resisted it, it would be admirable. Lack of response will also be a decision. Either way, it is necessary to obtain information and make a quick decision.\nAll loops are similar in a way, whether it is bishops, scientists or politicians who provide information. At first, it is not so important what the information is, because what is important is that there is information, decisions, action. At this level of generality, it is more important that we can divide the flow of information into fast and slow, but, above all, depending on the reactions it provokes. Looking at the example of a ship’s helmsman, we can say that there are two types of these loops. The helmsman turns to the right, the sailors shout, “Turn harder, and we will safely avoid the rocks.” Then, the helmsman turns harder to the right, i.e., the feedback reinforces his previous decisions. If, on the other hand, the information he receives is “Mistake, we’re about to crash,” the helmsman knows he must countersteer in the other direction. In cybernetics, these two reactions are referred to as positive or negative.\nOne example of positive feedback is environmental protection. The world is talking loudly about environmental protection, the Pope issues an encyclical on environmental protection, more people are involved in environmental protection, their voice is better heard, and the Pope issues further documents on environmental protection. An example of a negative reaction is when a politician makes a controversial statement on a certain topic. This would cause widespread outrage, and then the government spokesperson would soften the tone of the statement by interpreting it in a less radical way, more in line with the sensibilities of the public."

    "text": "Innovation vs. continuity\nLet’s try to translate this into the problem of steering a ship. We have sailors and a helmsman. If everyone can shout, “Turn left!”, there will be so much noise that it might as well be no information at all. On the other hand, it would be good to have an emergency exit so that someone could run to the captain and shout “Iceberg ahead!”1. Similarly, with the course, you cannot steer a transatlantic liner like a one-man boat. A certain stability is needed. On the other hand, innovation is needed, the ability to quickly find a solution in a flood of information.\nEach solution has its strengths and weaknesses. Flatter solutions allow for more interaction, but they can also be an attempt to circumvent doctrinal constraints by blurring responsibility and public referendums. The problem of speed of decision-making can be illustrated by the example of military decisions. What good is it if someone makes the right decision, but in the meantime, their army is destroyed?"

Search criteria: “boat” and “Peter.”\n\n\nThe first passage mentioned here describes the scene when Jesus walks on water:\n\n24 Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore, was being tossed about by the waves, for the wind was against it. 25 During the fourth watch of the night,* he came toward them, walking on the sea. 26 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified. “It is a ghost,” they said, and they cried out in fear. 27 At once [Jesus] spoke to them, “Take courage, it is I;* do not be afraid.” 28 Peter said to him in reply, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” 29 He said, “Come.” Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus. 30 j But when he saw how [strong] the wind was he became frightened; and, beginning to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” 31 Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, and said to him, “O you of little faith,* why did you doubt?” 32 After they got into the boat, the wind died down. 33 * k Those who were in the boat did him homage, saying, “Truly, you are the Son of God.”\n– Mt 14:24–33\n\n\n\n\nGiotto di Bondone, Navicella, Vatican\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a bountiful catch, Peter acknowledges his sinfulness:\n\n4 After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch.” 5 Simon said in reply, “Master, we have worked hard all night and have caught nothing, but at your command I will lower the nets.” 6 When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish and their nets were tearing. 7 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come to help them. They came and filled both boats so that they were in danger of sinking. 8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees of Jesus and said, “Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.” 9 For astonishment at the catch of fish they had made seized him and all those with him, 10 and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners of Simon. Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.” 11 When they brought their boats to the shore, they left everything* and followed him.\n– Lk 5:4–11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn January 29, 1380, St. Catherine of Siena contemplated this image. At one point, she felt that “the boat had fallen and landed on her shoulders.” Crushed by the weight of the boat, she fell to the floor. She understood that she had to give her life for the Church. She was never able to walk again, paralyzed from the waist down, and died three months later. (Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Bilddatenbank., Public Domain.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the closing scene of the Gospels, “The Risen Lord Appears Beside the Sea Of Galilee”:\n\n3 Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We also will come with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.b 4 When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore; but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.c 5 Jesus said to them, “Children, have you caught anything to eat?” They answered him, “No.”d 6 So he said to them, “Cast the net over the right side of the boat and you will find something.” So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in because of the number of fish. 7 So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord.” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad, and jumped into the sea. 8 The other disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards, dragging the net with the fish.\n– Jn 21:3–8\n\nIn each of these passages, Jesus himself solves the problems of the Apostles, which they were unable to deal with on their own.\n\nmore\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\nFr. Tomasz Włodarczyk\n\n\n\n© 2025 Ks.

She was never able to walk again, paralyzed from the waist down, and died three months later. (Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Bilddatenbank., Public Domain.)"

    "text": "Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles, Homily 4\n[…] Did they (the Apostles) not fight against poverty and hunger: against ignominy and infamy (for they were accounted deceivers): did they not fight against ridicule and wrath and mockery?— for in their case the contraries met: some laughed at them, others punished them — were they not made a mark for the wrathful passions, and for the merriment, of whole cities? Exposed to factions and conspiracies: to fire, and sword, and wild beasts? Did not war beset them from every quarter, in ten thousand forms? And were they any more affected in their minds by all these things, than they would have been at seeing them in a dream or in a picture? With bare body they took the field against all the armed, though against them all men had arbitrary power [against them, were]: terrors of rulers, force of arms, in cities and strong walls: without experience, without skill of the tongue, and in the condition of quite ordinary men, matched against juggling conjurors, against impostors, against the whole throng of sophists, of rhetoricians, of philosophers grown mouldy in the Academy and the walks of the Peripatetics, against all these they fought the battle out. And the man whose occupation had been about lakes, so mastered them, as if it cost him not so much ado as even a contest with dumb fishes: for just as if the opponents he had to outwit were indeed more mute than fishes, so easily did he get the better of them! And Plato, that talked a deal of nonsense in his day, is silent now, while this man utters his voice everywhere; not among his own countrymen alone, but also among Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and in India, and in every part of the earth, and to the extremities of the world. Where now is Greece, with her big pretentions? Where the name of Athens? Where the ravings of the philosophers? He of Galilee, he of Bethsaida, he, the uncouth rustic, has overcome them all. Are you not ashamed — confess it — at the very name of the country of him who has defeated you? But if you hear his own name too, and learn that he was called Cephas, much more will you hide your faces. This, this has undone you quite; because you esteem this a reproach, and account glibness of tongue a praise, and want of glibness a disgrace. You have not followed the road you ought to have chosen, but leaving the royal road, so easy, so smooth, you have trodden one rough, and steep, and laborious. And therefore you have not attained unto the kingdom of heaven.\nWhy then, it is asked, did not Christ exercise His influence upon Plato, and upon Pythagoras? Because the mind of Peter was much more philosophical than their minds. They were in truth children shifted about on all sides by vain glory; but this man was a philosopher, one apt to receive grace. If you laugh at these words, it is no wonder; for those aforetime laughed, and said, the men were full of new wine. But afterwards, when they suffered those bitter calamities, exceeding all others in misery; when they saw their city falling in ruins, and the fire blazing, and the walls hurled to the ground, and those manifold frantic horrors, which no one can find words to express, they did not laugh then. And you will laugh then, if you have the mind to laugh, when the time of hell is close at hand, when the fire is kindled for your souls. But why do I speak of the future? Shall I show you what Peter is, and what Plato, the philosopher? Let us for the present examine their respective habits, let us see what were the pursuits of each. The one wasted his time about a set of idle and useless dogmas, and philosophical, as he says, that we may learn that the soul of our philosopher becomes a fly. Most truly said, a fly! not indeed changed into one, but a fly must have entered upon possession of the soul which dwelt in Plato; for what but a fly is worthy of such ideas! The man was full of irony, and of jealous feelings against every one else, as if he made it his ambition to introduce nothing useful, either out of his own head or other people’s. Thus he adopted the metempsychosis from another, and from himself produced the Republic, in which he enacted those laws full of gross turpitude. Let the women, he says, be in common, and let the virgins go naked, and let them wrestle before the eyes of their lovers, and let there also be common fathers, and let the children begotten be common. But with us, not nature makes common fathers, but the philosophy of Peter does this; as for that other, it made away with all paternity. For Plato’s system only tended to make the real father next to unknown, while the false one was introduced. It plunged the soul into a kind of intoxication and filthy wallowing. Let all, he says, have intercourse with the women without fear. The reason why I do not examine the maxims of poets, is, that I may not be charged with ripping up fables. And yet I am speaking of fables much more ridiculous than even those. Where have the poets devised anything so portentous as this? But (not to enter into the discussion of his other maxims), what say you to these — when he equips the females with arms, and helmets, and greaves, and says that the human race has no occasion to differ from the canine! Since dogs, he says, the female and the male, do just the same things in common, so let the women do the same works as the men, and let all be turned upside down. For the devil has always endeavored by their means to show that our race is not more honorable than that of brutes; and, in fact, some have gone to such a pitch of (κενοδοξίας) absurdity, as to affirm that the irrational creatures are endued with reason. And see in how many various ways he has run riot in the minds of those men! For whereas their leading men affirmed that our soul passes into flies, and dogs, and brute creatures; those who came after them, being ashamed of this, fell into another kind of turpitude, and invested the brute creatures with all rational science, and made out that the creatures — which were called into existence on our account — are in all respects more honorable than we! They even attribute to them foreknowledge and piety. The crow, they say, knows God, and the raven likewise, and they possess gifts of prophecy, and foretell the future; there is justice among them, and polity, and laws. Perhaps you do not credit the things I am telling you. And well may you not, nurtured as you have been with sound doctrine; since also, if a man were fed with this fare, he would never believe that there exists a human being who finds pleasure in eating dung. The dog also among them is jealous, according to Plato. But when we tell them that these things are fables, and are full of absurdity, ‘You do not enter (ἐ νοήσατε) into the higher meaning,’ say they. No, we do not enter into this your surpassing nonsense, and may we never do so: for it requires (of course! ) an excessively profound mind, to inform me, what all this impiety and confusion would be at. Are you talking, senseless men, in the language of crows, as the children are wont (in play)? For you are in very deed children, even as they. But Peter never thought of saying any of these things: he uttered a voice, like a great light shining out in the dark, a voice which scattered the mist and darkness of the whole world. Again, his deportment, how gentle it was, how considerate (ἐ πιεικὲς); how far above all vainglory; how he looked towards heaven without all self-elation, and this, even when raising up the dead! But if it had come to be in the power of any one of those senseless people (in mere fantasy of course) to do anything like it, would he not straightway have looked for an altar and a temple to be reared to him, and have wanted to be equal with the gods? Since in fact when no such sign is forthcoming, they are forever indulging such fantastic conceits. And what, pray you, is that Minerva of theirs, and Apollo, and Juno? They are different kinds of demons among them. And there is a king of theirs, who thinks fit to die for the mere purpose of being accounted equal with the gods. But not so the men here: no, just the contrary. Hear how they speak on the occasion of the lame man’s cure. You men of Israel, why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made him to walk? Acts 3:12 We also are men of like passions with you. Acts 14:14 But with those, great is the self-elation, great the bragging; all for the sake of men’s honors, nothing for the pure love of truth and virtue. (φιλοσοφίας ἔνεκεν.) For where an action is done for glory, all is worthless. For though a man possess all, yet if he have not the mastery over this (lust), he forfeits all claim to true philosophy, he is in bondage to the more tyrannical and shameful passion. Contempt of glory; this it is that is sufficient to teach all that is good, and to banish from the soul every pernicious passion. I exhort you therefore to use the most strenuous endeavors to pluck out this passion by the very roots; by no other means can you have good esteem with God, and draw down upon you the benevolent regard of that Eye which never sleeps. Wherefore, let us use all earnestness to obtain the enjoyment of that heavenly influence, and thus both escape the trial of present evils, and attain unto the future blessings, through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, power, honor, now and ever, and to all ages.

    "text": "Artistitle’s Politics\nAristotle explains that phenomena as follows:\nHence it is also possible to meet in this way the question which some persons investigate and put forward （for some raise the question whether the legislator desiring to lay down the rightest laws should legislate with a view to the advantage of the better people or that of the larger number） in cases when the situation mentioned1 occurs. And ‘right’ must be taken in the sense of ‘equally right,’ and this means right in regard to the interest of the whole state and in regard to the common welfare of the citizens; and a citizen is in general one who shares in governing and being governed,\n[1284a] [1] although he is different according to each form of constitution, but in relation to the best form a citizen is one who has the capacity and the will to be governed and to govern with a view to the life in accordance with virtue.\nBut if there is any one man so greatly distinguished in outstanding virtue, or more than one but not enough to be able to make up a complete state, so that the virtue of all the rest and their political ability is not comparable with that of the men mentioned, if they are several, or if one, with his alone, it is no longer proper to count these exceptional men a part of the state; for they will be treated unjustly if deemed worthy of equal status, being so widely unequal in virtue and in their political ability: since such a man will naturally be as a god among men. Hence it is clear that legislation also must necessarily be concerned with persons who are equal in birth and in ability, but there can be no law dealing with such men as those described, for they are themselves a law; indeed a man would be ridiculous if he tried to legislate for them, for probably they would say what in the story of Antisthenes1 the lions said2 when the hares made speeches in the assembly and demanded that all should have equality. This is why democratically governed states institute the system of ostracism, because of a reason of this nature; for these are the states considered to pursue equality most of all things, [20] so that they used to ostracize men thought to be outstandingly powerful on account of wealth or popularity or some other form of political strength, and used to banish them out of the city for fixed periods of time. And there is a mythical story that the Argonauts left Heracles behind for a similar reason; for the Argo3 refused to carry him with the others because he was so much heavier than the sailors. Hence also those who blame tyranny and Periander’s advice to Thrasybulus must not be thought to be absolutely right in their censure (the story is that Periander made no reply to the herald sent to ask his advice, but levelled the corn-field by plucking off the ears that stood out above the rest; and consequently, although the herald did not know the reason for what was going on, when he carried back news of what had occurred, Thrasybulus understood that he was to destroy the outstanding citizens); for this policy is advantageous not only for tyrants, nor is it only tyrants that use it, but the same is the case with oligarchies and democracies as well; for ostracism has in a way the same effect as docking off the outstanding men by exile. And the same course is adopted in regard to cities and races by the holders of sovereign power, for example the Athenians so dealt with the Samians and Chians and Lesbians5 （for no sooner did they get a strong hold of their empire than they humbled them in contravention of their covenants）,\n[1284b] [1] and the king of the Persians frequently used to cut down the numbers of the Medes and Babylonians and the other races that had waxed proud because they had once been head of an empire. And the problem applies universally to all the forms of constitution, even the right forms; for while the divergent forms of government do this because their regard is fixed on their private advantage, nevertheless with the constitutions directed to the common good the same is the case. And this is also clear in the field of the other arts and sciences; a painter would not let his animal have its foot of disproportionately large size, even though it was an exceptionally beautiful foot, nor would a shipbuilder make the stern or some other part of a ship disproportionately big, nor yet will a trainer of choruses allow a man who sings louder and more beautifully than the whole band to be a member of it. Hence as far as this practice goes nothing prevents monarchs from being in harmony with the cities they rule, if they resort to it when their own personal rule is beneficial to the cities. Therefore in relation to acknowledged superiorities the argument for ostracism has a certain element of political justice. True, it is better for the lawgiver so to constitute the state at the outset that it does not need this medicine; but the next best course to steer, if occasion arises, is to endeavor to correct [20] the constitution by some such method of rectification. But this was not what happened with the states, for they were not looking at what was advantageous for their proper constitution, but their acts of ostracism were done in a revolutionary spirit. In the divergent forms of constitution therefore it is evident that ostracism is advantageous and just under the special constitution, though perhaps it is also evident that it is not1 just absolutely; but in the case of the best constitution there is much doubt as to what ought to be done, not as regards superiority in the other things of value, such as strength and wealth and popularity, but in the case of a person becoming exceptionally distinguished for virtue. It certainly would not be said that such a man must be banished and got out of the way; yet nevertheless no doubt men would not think that they ought to rule over such a man, for that would be the same as if they claimed to rule over Zeus, dividing up his spheres of government. It remains therefore, and this seems to be the natural course, for all to obey such a man gladly, so that men of this sort may be kings in the cities for all time.(Aristotle 1944)\nIn Australia and New Zealand, the phrase “tall poppy syndrome” is used to describe the tendency to criticize or undermine successful people.\nCompare: The crab mentality\n\nmore\n\n\n\n\nAuthor\n\nFr. Tomasz Włodarczyk\n\n\n\n© 2025 Ks.

    "text": "In my last article, I presented passages that contained words such as “boat” and “Peter.” These passages are well known, but it is interesting that passages from the Gospels of John and Mark, which also mention this event, were omitted. They were omitted because St. Peter was not mentioned there. In this post, I will show you how to answer the question of which passages in the Bible use a certain word, what it sounds like in the original, and how it was translated in the Bible. The Bible was written in Greek and Hebrew, so a basic knowledge of these languages is useful for this search."

    "title": "How to search for words in the Bible?",
    "section": "Why?",
    "text": "Why?\nSearching for words in the Bible is very important, not only for exegetes, but for every believer. In the field of church leadership, the ability to check all occurrences of a given word allows for independent interpretation. First, it allows for a deeper understanding of certain topics in the Bible. For example, if you want to know what the Bible says about loving your enemies, you can compare the Pentateuch, the Historical Books, and the New Testament and see how the understanding of this love has evolved. Second, such a search allows for contextual analysis. We believe that the Bible is the Holy Scripture inspired by God, and that every word has a meaning intended by Him that needs to be discovered. Although different books were written by different authors, they have one divine Author—the Holy Spirit. Therefore, it can be said that the Bible interprets itself.\nIn practice, this means that if, for example, the word “lamp” appears in Revelation and it is difficult to understand what it means from the context, you can check where else in that book the word is used. Then you can look up where the word appears in the New Testament or the entire Bible. Each occurrence of the word has a different context, which allows you to learn new aspects of its meaning. For example, the word “faith” can appear in different contexts, in one meaning an attitude — trust, and in another a set of beliefs about the structure and origin of the universe. Thirdly, for those translating the Bible, such an analysis allows them to choose the right word to use in the translation. On the other hand, it allows those reading the Bible to check whether a “new translation of the Bible” is justified. For example, does the Bible refer to foolish virgins or imprudent virgins?\nFrom the point of view of church leadership, this is also very important. Faith is based on Scripture and Tradition, so by manipulating the translation, one can influence the content of people’s faith and attitudes. Having the tools and procedures to examine the original text allows one to arrive at the original meaning in a factual manner. It is also an excellent exercise in searching for and verifying information based on sources, which protects against manipulation. Especially today, when the public space is flooded with content generated by artificial intelligence and it is often very difficult to distinguish reality from fiction, the ability to verify information is invaluable."

    "text": "We are not Peripatetics, but fishermen. This sentence aptly reflects the age-old dispute within the Church, between the influence of Greek philosophy, symbolized by Athens, and the Jewish faith and heritage, represented by Jerusalem. Does this dispute also explain the current crisis facing the Church: the question of leadership and governance in the Church, how to approach the challenges of artificial intelligence and digitalization? Should they be resolved like Aristotle or Plato, or like the simple fisherman, Saint Peter? This important question has implications for the specific challenges we face.\nWhat is the role of the Dicastery for the Faith? How should synodality be understood? Which is more important, Greek democracy or Jewish hierarchy? This question is very relevant, and the answer to it determines the response to contemporary challenges. How should we argue, on the basis of philosophers, technologists, or the Holy Scriptures, or perhaps there is no need for argumentation, but everything should be accepted on faith. Two metaphors, Peter’s boat and Plato’s ship, illustrate two approaches to these problems. At the same time, they challenge conventional thinking about leadership."

    "text": "Plato:\nLet’s take a closer look at Plato’s parable. We are in the seventh book of The Republic, and Plato wants to explain why philosophers are not respected in the state. The navigator is the King, who must lead an unreasonable crew. This text has become the basis for understanding how to govern a state. It shows the fundamental dilemma faced by those in power. Should they be guided by the will of the people, or by some objective reality? In other words, should they please the crew of the ship, or look at the stars and base their decisions on them? A historical example is Paul VI’s encyclical Humanae Vitae. The Pope had to decide whether, for example, to be guided by the fact that many people use contraception and allow it, or to consider what attitude towards contraception is derived from Catholic doctrine, and act accordingly. The same applies to usury. Plato says here that the state must be governed by science and truth. Popper, who was one of Plato’s greatest critics, argues that this approach gave rise to totalitarianism. Plato, considered the greatest philosopher, proposes that the ship be steered by the greatest minds."

    "text": "Peter:\nWhen we look at St. Peter’s fishing boat, the difference between Peter and Plato’s philosopher-navigator is striking. Peter, a local businessman, a devout Jew who knows the basics of Greek, to the extent that he needs it to conduct business, did not write any treatises. Even the accounts of Christ’s encounters were written down by Saint Mark. Peter does not act like a navigator who carefully plans, calculates and weighs things up, but more on the basis of instinct or inspiration. This testifies to his greatness, but it also becomes his problem. Some inspirations come from God: You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God, others come from himself, from his idea of the church, this will never happen to you, and then he is sharply rebuked. If we look at the Gospel at the passage where Peter and the boat appear, a question about Jesus arises.\nWe have a triangle: Peter – Boat – Jesus. This question was also present in later dilemmas concerning the leadership of the Church. The question of who the Pope is was a question of whether he is a helmsman or a navigator, whether he sets the course or keeps watch over it. Anyway, as the Acts of the Apostles show, Peter does not try to get his way at all costs, but is open to criticism from St. Paul, and decides together with others at the Council of Jerusalem."

    "section": "When and why to use each of these solutions?",
    "text": "When and why to use each of these solutions?\nBoth solutions have their strengths and weaknesses. An approach based on expertise is necessary for technical solutions. Sending a mission to the moon, writing an encyclical on artificial intelligence. Environment-oriented leadership may be necessary when we want people’s support. In a crisis situation, do we turn to a doctor or a friend? Experience shows that people should be involved at the project development stage.\nAn expert approach may overestimate its ability to predict; reality is sometimes too complex to be captured in detail in schemes, and even when this happens, there is no guarantee that decision-makers will agree to a very complex solution that they do not understand. On the other hand, a happy-go-lucky approach, where everything is done on a hunch, without analysis, without knowledge, just on the basis of “the nobility will get on their horses and somehow it will work out,” can also make us like a gang of teenagers in a joint venture, but we lack knowledge of navigation, stars, and mathematics, and we will not reach the port. We need both a crew and a goal in sight.\nHowever, these models do not have to be mutually exclusive, but can complement each other. Every project has a technical element, where expert knowledge is essential, and a human element, based on relationships, group thinking, conversation, and conflicts of values. Choosing solutions for issues that affect people are related to the sphere of values, so they cannot be based solely on a mathematical model, but we must clearly specify which values are most important to us.\nBesides, both images can be treated as saying the same thing. Plato argues against the Sophists that one cannot be guided by the Demos when steering a ship, but must ask about ideas, purpose, and truth. Peter, on the other hand, shows that it is important whether Jesus is in the boat to set the course. When Peter tries to manipulate the course, he receives harsh criticism, perhaps the harshest in the entire Bible: Get behind me, Satan…"
